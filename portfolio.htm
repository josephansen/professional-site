        <h3>My DFS Lineup Building Site</h3>
		
        	<p class="description">This is the first website that I've created. This was the first project that I had to make for school. Our task was to create a website with multiple pages about something that interests us. I chose to make my website about Daily Fantasy Sports. I have been playing Daily Fantasy Sports for three years now and have profited throughout those three years so I decided to share some of the tips and tricks that I use when creating lineups for various sports contests.</p>
        
        	<p class="description">My DFS Lineup Building Site, is constructed from HTML and CSS. The website has a header that is consistant on each page of the site and has a navigation bar under that header for maneuvering between pages. In the footer of each page there are links to two popular DFS sites that I use, FanDuel and Draft Kings, as well as link to my email address for anyone who has any questions.</p>

        <h3>Form Project</h3>
        
        	<p class="description">This website is a simple form project. This form is a fictitious return form that requires the user to insert information into varous fields and prompts them via CAPTCHA. Upon a successful submission, the form directs the user to a verification page that contains a verification message directed toward the user.</p>
        
        	<p class="description">This website is constructed of HTML, CSS, and javascript. The javascript enforces requirements on the form fields requiring users to enter valid information. For every field that is not filled out correctly, an error message is concatonated together and displayed when the user attempts to submit the form. The page the user is directed to following a successful submission uses the information the user entered to display a verification message. The information submitted is passed to the new page by the URL and then the information is parsed into properties of an object through javascript.</p>
